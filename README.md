utilized YouTube for code on math
utilized BlackBox AI for check and recheck code, until it jsut stopped on me.
went back to my ChatGPT for code proofing.

In summary, I liked looking at the data in ways that were not asked for in the assignment. 
Looking up and comparing area codes may lead to putting a warehouse in that area code to 
speed up delivery, offer lower shipping costs and increase customer service. 
I also wanted to know how many like-minded occupations there were. This would again create some 
opportunity in servicing customers' needs better. I found it interesting that "bathroom supplies" was the most ordered. 
I assume that would maybe be a better category if labeled "office cleaning supplies",
or offer that as a subcategory to identify ordering patterns. 

The most difficult code structure was trying to validate invoices. Had to go back up
in code to account for quantity of units sold included "total" unit weight. At first
I only had 1 unit weight calculated even if they ordered 10 units. Once this code was corrected 
I came within .01 of email invoice, my only solution was to come up with an 
acceptable tolerance of .02 to get the code to answer "True". Hopefully, I will learn
a better way to write that code so I don't need to add tolerance. I tried and tired 
different thoughts on code. 

Overall, the challenge utilized the skills up to this point, but I feel like sometimes 
I write more lines than necessary.
